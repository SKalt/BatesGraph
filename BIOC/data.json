Through historical, scientific, cultural, and bioethical lenses, students examine biomedical science in Latin America and the struggle for civil, human, and health rights by workers in the Chilean mining industry since the nineteenth century. The study of historical and cultural narratives alongside the application of the scientific approach to problem solving and laboratory experimentation provide students with a foundation for further on-site examination of biomedical science in Chile, where they consider the Chilean mining industry to contextulize principles of science and health policy, the impact of scientific practices on human populations, and the intererconnectedness of state policy, public health, and human welfare.
