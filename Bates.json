Authors such as Chaucer, Langland, and Gower witnessed the ravages of the Black Death, the Hundred Years War, the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, the tyranny and deposition of Richard II, and religious repression. Students explore how these writers and others walked the fine line between offering topical commentary and avoiding radicalism in the context of plague, rebellion, war, usurpation, treason, heresy, and outlawry. They consider what forms that literary protest took and ask whether literature itself became a symbol of dissent. Finally, students investigate the implications of \"the literature of dissent\" as a category for the Middle Ages and for our own time. Prerequisite(s): one 100-level English course.

How do surreal fictions manage the essential components of storytelling, such as character, allusion, metaphor, and verisimilitude? What sorts of truths can be unearthed through stories that challenge or defy reason?

It considers Kant's attempt to make morality \"safe\" from luck and the way Aristotle embraces luck in his moral outlook.

According to this understanding, the universe has evolved from a hot, dense, and rapidly expanding soup of elementary particles into the system of galaxies we see today.  But the picture is not complete, and topping the list of unresolved puzzles is the identity of the so-called dark matter.  We cannot see the dark matter (hence its name), but we do measure its gravitational influences on matter we can see.  The disconcerting conclusion is that there is much more dark matter than visible matter.

St. Petersburg: Peter's Impossible City.","concentrations":["Russian Language (C069)"],"description":"Founded by Peter the Great during Russia's lengthy war with Sweden, Sankt Pieter Burkh was celebrated as Peter's \"window on the West.\" Peter the Great himself called it \"paradise.\" But Peter's paradise was, for most Russians of the early eighteenth century, nothing more or less than the city of an after-death world founded by the tsar-antichrist. Sankt Pieter Burkh\u2014later known as St. Petersburg, Petrograd, Leningrad, or simply Piter, as more recent inhabitants affectionately call it\u2014has survived domestic and foreign enemies, natural and civil disasters, and revolutions of all varieties. Today \"Peter's impossible city\" occupies a unique place in the Russian psyche. In this course students examine the city's symbolic place in Russian culture and its role in modern Russian history from 1703 to the present. Open to first-year students. D. Browne, K.
