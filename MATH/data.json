The subject's early development was intimately connected with understanding rates of change within the context of the physical sciences. Since then, it has proven to be widely applicable throughout the natural sciences and some social sciences, as well as crucial to the development of most modern technology. This course develops the key notions of derivatives and integrals and their interrelationship, as well as applications. An emphasis is placed on conceptual understanding and interpretation, as well as on computational skills. Graphing calculators are used in the course. Students are required to attend five additional 50-minute laboratory sessions at times to be arranged. Students must read the  before registering. Prior calculus work generally excludes students from this course. Not open to students who have received equivalent course credit through AP, IB, or A-Level examination scores.
