By exploring narratives about Berlin in Berlin, students draw their own maps of the city and compare them with existing urban landscape. They follow the traces of the Berlin Wall, place destroyed buildings back on the skyline, discover the city's empty spaces, listen to the voices of its missing inhabitants, and cross bridges between cultures and languages, interacting with the past through language, architecture, literature, and the visual arts.

Sankt Pieter Burkh\u2014later known as St. Petersburg, Petrograd, Leningrad, or simply Piter, as more recent inhabitants affectionately call it\u2014has survived domestic and foreign enemies, natural and civil disasters, and revolutions of all varieties. Today \"Peter's impossible city\" occupies a unique place in the Russian psyche. In this course students examine the city's symbolic place in Russian culture and its role in modern Russian history from 1703 to the present. Open to first-year students. D. Browne, K.

We explore the microbial basis of traditional foods and beverages, examine the roles of microbes in the cycling of elements in composting and kitchen gardening at dachas, and consider the effects of microbial outbreaks of historic significance.
