Human Rights and Social Art in Latin America: The Case of Nogales, Mexico.","Description":"This course focuses on the social dynamics that generate social art committed to change in Latin America. Students examine three settings in which artists utilize the arts to generate aesthetic and production models that represent the \"uniqueness of place.\" During ten days off campus, students work with artists who engage technology to raise consciousness about the \"needs of place.\"  In Nogales, Mexico, students consider human rights discourses that address migrants' dislocation. They also work with volunteers, hike the desert, and visit shelters to contextualize the social and natural environments. Prerequisite(s): SPAN 207. Enrollment limited to 15.

Sports, Gender, and Nation in Latin America.","Description":"The state and civil society in Latin America have been involved in the individual practice of professional sports that channel aspirations of inclusion among different social, ethnic, and racial groups. Sports in Latin America developed into a phenomenon of mass spectatorship that supersedes and at times replaces political debate. In Latin America national and local pride are challenged by transnational sport stars in a time of increasing globalization. This course considers the history of sports in Latin America from male- dominated origins (soccer, baseball, boxing) to the more recent media attention on Latin American women in Olympic disciplines, which challenges the identification of the nation with the male body.
