Medieval London.","Description":"Medieval London was dangerous and thrilling: amid its markets, brothels, and taverns, citizens and foreigners plied their trades while Parliament convened treason trials and authorized public executions, the king held court attended by the royal family and assorted minions, and the monks at Westminster Abbey took notes on daily life in the city.  This course looks at medieval London through the texts composed by its contemporary writers and residents, including Chaucer, Gower, Langland, Lydgate, and Hoccleve (in Middle English). Students also examine legal records, chronicles, and parliamentary proceedings (in translation). No previous experience with Middle English is necessary. Enrollment limited to 15.

Creative Nonfiction.","Description":"A creative nonfiction writer tells a true story in an inventive and original manner. Or as John McPhee says, \"Creative nonfiction is not making something up but making the most of what you have.\" In this course students will write four creative nonfiction essays in the following genres: memoir, lyric, travelogue, and art review. Above all, students will learn to see writing as an act, not as a product. To that end, we will conduct workshops in which ideas and critiques of the above-mentioned writing assignments are thoughtfully offered. To further fuel our writing assignments and workshop we will read a wide-ranging selection of creative nonfiction essays, studying figurative language, character and setting development, and dramatic structure.
