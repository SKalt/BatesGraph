Over the last three decades, China has experienced rapid structural change as tens of millions of Chinese have moved out of the agriculture sector and into the industrial and service sectors. The concomitant migration of workers from the countryside to urban areas is the largest migration in human history. Students focus on the distributional implications of China's reform experience. They consider which institutional legacies are shaping emerging labor markets, how far China has moved toward a market-determined labor system, and which segments of China's enormous population have benefited and which have been harmed by the reforms.

In the twenty-first century, control of these rights is the basis for many of the worlds's most valuable companies (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft). Ironically, the rules governing the intellectual property of the twenty-first century were themselves devised hundreds of years earlier. Advances in information technology over the past fifty years have rendered many of these rules obsolete. In addition, the role of IPR in the creation and distribution of wealth within and among nations has given rise to profound questions of equity regarding access to the benefits of innovation by disadvantaged groups.
