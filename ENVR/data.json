Basic concepts of rock-water interactions, chemical equilibria, and biogeochemical cycling are presented in the context of natural settings as well as those influenced by anthropogenic activity. Students work on local environmental problems, which may include surface and groundwater contamination by salt, arsenic, nutrients, and/or heavy metals; acid mine drainage; and the history of lead deposition. The laboratory includes fieldwork and GIS, chemical analysis of environmental samples using inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy, and stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry and modeling using STELLA.

The Secret History of French Peasants.","Description":"What sets rural France apart from the urban world? What drives village politics, economics, and morality? How do rural cultures interact with the natural world? Ever since people began packing their bags for the big city, peasants, their culture, and their engagement with the environment has been scrutinized. Historians, anthropologists, tourists, novelists, painters, and photographers studied rural life, and peasants themselves wrote memoirs. This course explores interpretations of rural people and landscapes in France during four major turning points: religious turmoil of the 14th c., social upheaval of the 18th c., industrialization and nationalization in the 19th c., and re-ruralification in the 20th c.    Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 40. (European.) One-time offering. K.

Field Methods in Environmental Science/Lab.","Description":"Evaluating environmental problems often requires the collection of air, water, or soil samples from field sites. Knowing how to gather information and samples and how to be sure that they help address the questions at hand is challenging. In this course, students consider approaches for matching sampling design to study objectives, dealing with spatial and temporal heterogeneity in field materials, utilizing previously published approaches, insuring utility of data, and replication of studies. Students design and carry out their own study utilizing approaches learned in class. A one-week stay off campus at a field site may be required.
