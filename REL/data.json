Religion and the Monstrous Feminine.","Description":"Religion tells us what we should shun: the unfamiliar, the impermissible, the Other. We turn to religion to protect us from demons, vampires, and other monsters. Knowing what scares us tells us who we are, what we want, and what we cannot or will not tolerate. How, then, do we make sense of the monstrous feminine? This course uses monsters and the concept of the monstrous to introduce fundamental concepts in the academic study of religion and gender. Students analyze popular culture sources, including films, short stories, and graphic novels, in conversation with scholarship on religion and cultural studies to explore what monstrosity can tell us about religious and embodiment.
