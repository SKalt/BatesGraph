Economics of Not-for-Profit Firms.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course studies the not-for-profit (NFP) firm as an institutional form that society has used in response to market failures, such as those caused by the presence of jointly consumed goods, asymmetric information, or principal-agent problems.

Issues related to the financing of NFPs, including their capital structure and their reliance on donations as opposed to commercial revenues, are also explored.

The Economics of Intellectual Property.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Intellectual property rights (IPR) are the means by which innovators may receive a reward for their inventions. In the twenty-first century, control of these rights is the basis for many of the worlds's most valuable companies (e.g., Apple, Google, Microsoft). Ironically, the rules governing the intellectual property of the twenty-first century were themselves devised hundreds of years earlier. Advances in information technology over the past fifty years have rendered many of these rules obsolete. In addition, the role of IPR in the creation and distribution of wealth within and among nations has given rise to profound questions of equity regarding access to the benefits of innovation by disadvantaged groups. This course examines the theory and practice of IPR around the world using case studies and empirical analysis. Prerequisite(s): ECON 255 and 260. Enrollment limited to 15. J.
