Big Data and Economics.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Economics is at the forefront of developing statistical methods for analyzing data collected from uncontrolled sources. Since econometrics addresses challenges in estimation such as sample selection bias and treatment effects identification, the discipline is well-suited for the analysis of large and unsystematically collected datasets. This course introduces statistical (machine) learning methods, which have been developed for analyzing such datasets but which have only recently been implemented in economic research. The course also explores how econometrics and statistical learning methods cross-fertilize and can  be used to advance knowledge in the numerous domains where large volumes of data are rapidly accumulating.

Six Beverages That Changed The World.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Many distinguishing characteristics of today's world are the result of the production, demand, and trade in six beverages: beer, wine, rum, coffee, tea, and Coca Cola.
