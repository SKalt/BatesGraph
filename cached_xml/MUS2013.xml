These questions, long fascinating to philosophers, are now being reopened through the scientific study of the brain and mind.

Junior-Senior Seminar in Musicology: Texts, Performances, Recordings.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The field of musicology was created with the purpose of perpetuating the notated music of past eras as a musical tradition. Musicologists have created canons of works, editing their texts and offering guidance to their performance. But the field has increasingly concerned itself with unnotated kinds of music as well, especially folk music and jazz. Some scholars have treated this unnotated music as texts&#8212;through transcriptions, recordings, and film&#8212;while others have demanded more appropriate approaches to it. At the same time, scholars working on notated music have challenged the field's tradition of text worship. This course introduces the debates.

The development of a feasible research problem and the forging of logical relationships between project design components are emphasized. Processes of participant observation, interviewing, and various techniques of documentation become part of the student ethnographer's toolkit. Students analyze and interpret their gathered materials from within a selected theoretical perspective, culminating in a final, multimedia document. Recent project topics in this course have included: musical life at the first United Pentecostal Church in Lewiston, Radiohead subculture at Bates, busking in Portland, and a cappella culture.

The enormous popularity of this music challenges some of our most deeply held cultural assumptions, and raises crucial questions about the relationships among music, technology, the body, and culture: How do various subgenres of electronic dance music map out our sense of postindustrial reality? In what ways do the use (and deliberate misuse) of such sound technologies as turntables, digital samplers, drum machines, and musical software challenge traditional notions of musical authorship and authenticity? In what sense do these genres and subcultures present alternative models of sexuality, or different ways of understanding the politics of the body? Enrollment limited to 30. D.

Leaving Downtown: Minimal Music Beyond The New York School.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Minimalism is a flexible aesthetic concept that has expressed itself in nearly every discipline of the fine and applied arts; it is a style wherein the fewest possible materials are used to create the maximum possible impact. In music, discussion of minimalism is often limited to a handful of seminal American works from the 1960s and 1970s and the composers they influence(d) directly. In this multidisciplinary course, students explore musical minimalism as it developed in other places and times. Through readings and guest lectures, students explore how minimal concert music intersects with design, architecture, landscape, theology, and popular music.  <span class="crsaddmod">New course beginning Short Term 2014.</span> Enrollment limited to 15.
