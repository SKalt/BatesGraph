Constructions of Italian-American Men and Masculinities.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">From Rudolph Valentino to The Godfather to Jersey Shore, American media-makers and audiences seem obsessed with the Italian American man. Seemingly American, but somehow not quite, these figures operate on the margins of the mainstream. By indulging their excessive appetites, they challenge cultural conventions and brazenly refuse to conform to accepted social norms. They engage in too many criminal activities. They have too many sex partners. They are too aggressive.  They eat too much. They party too hard. They dance like everyone&#8217;s watching (and they usually are). They win people over despite their inferior intelligence. And they don&#8217;t apologize for any of it. The Italian American male in American popular culture is a figure who is simultaneously admired and feared. His hyper-masculine daring may attract fans, but viewers are encouraged to question what the culture would look like if we were all so selfish and irresponsible. Indeed, the representation of the Italian American male indulges fantasies of total freedom while providing a cautionary tale that endorses social conformity.
This course will examine a series of Italian American representations to determine the cultural place of ethnicity, gender, sexuality, and class.  Special attention will be paid to the rhetorical usage of these overlapping identities.  In particular, we will investigate how these identifiers work to encourage conformity to more traditional gender and sexual norms. <span class="crsaddmod">New course beginning Winter 2014</span>

As might be expected, open-ended questions such as these have yielded no shortage of answers. This intermediate-level film studies course introduces students to some of the dominant theoretical models that have surfaced throughout the history of film theory (including formal film analysis, realism, Soviet montage theory, documentary theory, and experimental film theory) while also exploring issues of cultural studies, authorship, ideology, representation, digital cinema, reception studies, and global and transnational cinema. In coming to an understanding of these approaches, students develop a deeper comprehension of the cultural place and artistic significance of the movies. Prerequisite(s): one rhetoric course.
