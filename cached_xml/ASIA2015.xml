Envisioning the Human Future in Japanese Anime.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course considers Japanese animated movies and television series, or anime, and examines voices, sound effects, and graphics to understand how these construct an animated dystopic world envisioning posthuman civilizations. Why does anime seem more suitable and effective in representing the dark dystopia of postnuclear warfare periods than conventional film products? Why are anime characters so attractive when the works are essentially pursuing such negative themes? What sociopolitical or philosophical messages do these works contain, and do they bear relevance to our society at large? Finally, is there a human future? Open to first-year students.
