And despite the highest levels of poverty in the world, Africa as a whole has witnessed economic growth for the first time in two decades.

Environmental Justice.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">A critical examination of environmental thought at the intersection of contemporary arguments on political rights, social equality, and economic development. When does public regulation of health in the workplace and community conflict with the property rights of private corporations? Where does environmental thought illuminate and where does it obfuscate local and global problems related to racism and sexism? How does contemporary thinking about environmental problems come to terms with uneven economic development at home and abroad? Students think critically about arguments concerning environmental racism, ecofeminism, sustainable development, deep ecology, green political activism, and other issues from a variety of political perspectives.

<div class="Course"><a name="296"/><a name="PLTC296"/><h4 class="crsname">PLTC 296. Contract and Community.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Western political thought frequently explores relationships&#8212;including contracts and community&#8212;between individuals and the state, but the terms of this discourse are hotly contested. Why do "contracts" so often seem to ignore the unequal power of the parties involved? Must terms like "community" erase the politics of human difference? How do categories such as "individual" and "state" restrict even the politics of privileged men as well as neglect considerations of gender, race, and class? Students read and discuss a variety of texts, including Hobbes, Rousseau, and contemporary theorists. Not open to students who have received credit for Political Science 296.

<div class="Course"><a name="297"/><a name="PLTC297"/><h4 class="crsname">PLTC 297. The Household and Political Theory.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Western political theories often acknowledge, either implicitly or explicitly, the importance of domestic considerations&#8212;such as child bearing, sexual relations, and issues of home economics&#8212;but rarely appreciate their political significance. And sometimes theorists who acknowledge that the personal is political miss the significance of the so-called racial classification or class position of the domestic situations they study. Drawing from Western and non-Western feminist, socialist, and other sources, this course stresses close reading of theories that highlight the politics of domestic life. Because many of these arguments involve criticism of Western political thought, students also examine how various Western classics (for example, Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, or Hegel) situate domesticity.

Sexuality and the Politics of Difference.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Picture females and males learning how to be women and men by distancing themselves from each others' prescribed gender roles. What's missing from this picture? Identity politics often gives the impression that patterns of self and other are fixed in nature, culture, or both. The politics of difference marks a refusal to reduce life's ambiguities to orderly patterns. Various gay and lesbian constructions of sexuality provide suggestive terrain for exploring how theories of difference undermine fixed patterns of sexuality. Students read, discuss, and write about recent work in political theory within a context of difference influenced in part by Foucault, Lacan, and Derrida. Recommended background: Politics 191.

Who defines it? Who, or what, constitutes a threat? Why are "they" threatening? Where do threats begin? Where do they end? Who, or what, is being "secured"? How far can anyone of us go in order to "secure" ourselves? This course explores these and related questions from within a variety of theoretical approaches to international security, grouped loosely into "traditional" National Security approaches and "alternative" Critical Security approaches, the latter representing a peculiar mix of (Neo-Marxist) Frankfurt School, French Deconstructivism, and Copenhagen (De)Securitization Theory.

What roles do states play in shaping masculinities and notions of womanhood? Theoretical framings of gender and politics form the basis for reviewing women's and men's relationships to states. Students examine processes through which gender ideologies and gender regimes shape state power and policy while being subject themselves to change by state projects such as economic development or war. Using case studies of women's political activism, students investigate how women redefine their political roles and seek access to state power, thus articulating different visions of gender's relationship to the state.

Do contemporary formulations of this diverse and venerable tradition show how to negotiate the contested terrain of twenty-first-century cultural politics? Or is Western liberalism necessarily an apologist for the exclusionary politics of a bygone era?

Global Flows: Gender and Globalization.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Globalization processes underlie profound changes in politics from the state to private lives. This unit focuses on sex and gender&#8212;as aspects of global economics, war, and politics&#8212;to uncover how power is structured, used, and challenged in the transnational age. Sex trafficking, militarized prostitution, women's factory work, and intimate labor are some of the topics through which students examine flows of people, ideas, capital, and political strategies. In doing so, students ask: How do gender relations and gender ideologies affect global restructuring? How does globalization (re)shape notions of manhood, womanhood, and the ways people live out those ideas in sex, politics, and war?

<div class="Course"><a name="s33"/><a name="PLTCs33"/><h4 class="crsname">PLTC s33. Territoriality and Transnationalism.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">International relations scholar John Ruggie stated that neglecting territoriality in studying world politics is akin to not looking at the ground one walks upon. This unit takes a step toward correcting this oversight by examining how visions and orderings of space or "areas" shape the theory and practice of international and national politics. It brings together literature from human geography, politics, and cultural studies to understand and critique how countries, regions, and "the globe" are made and transformed through the representation and manipulation of spaces and identities. Taking the 11 September 2001 attacks as a focus, students engage in research that includes interviews with local residents. Recommended background: Politics 122.
