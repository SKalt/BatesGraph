Does music belong to an altered state of consciousness or is it a function of our ordinary state of consciousness? Are the emotions that we experience through music the same as those that spring from our personal experiences? Is music essentially an interior experience, and if so, how does it connect us so powerfully to others? How can music and speech become one in song? These questions, long fascinating to philosophers, are now being reopened through the scientific study of the brain and mind. Recommended background: previous study of music, neuroscience, or psychology.  <span class="crsaddmod"/> Not open to students who have received credit for MU/PY 253. Enrollment limited to 15. J.
