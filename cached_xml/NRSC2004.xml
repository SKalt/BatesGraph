<div class="Course"><a name="200"/><a name="NS/PY200"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 200. Introduction to Neuroscience.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">In this course, students study the structure and function of the nervous system, and how they are related to mind and behavior. Topics introduced include neuroanatomy, developmental neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, and neuropsychiatry. The course is aimed at prospective majors and nonmajors interested in exploring a field in which biology and psychology merge, and to which many other disciplines (e.g., chemistry, philosophy, anthropology, computer science) have contributed. Required of neuroscience majors. Prerequisite(s): Psychology 101 or any 100-level biology course.  Not open to students who have received credit for Neuroscience 200 or Psychology 200. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 50. Normally offered every year. J. Prichard.<br/></span></div>
<div class="Course"><a name="308"/><a name="BI/NS308"/><h4 class="crsname">BI/NS 308. Neurobiology.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The course is an introduction to the molecular and cellular principles of neurobiology, and the organization of neurons into networks. Also included are the topics of developmental and synaptic plasticity, and the role invertebrate systems have played in our understanding of these processes. Laboratories include electrical recordings of nerve cells, computer simulation and modeling, and the use of molecular techniques in neurobiology. Recommended background: Neuroscience/Psychology 200. Prerequisite(s): Biology s42. Not open to students who have received credit for Biology 308 or Neuroscience 308. Enrollment limited to 12 per section. Normally offered every year. N. Kleckner.<br/></span></div>
<div class="Course"><a name="330"/><a name="NS/PY330"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 330. Cognitive Neuroscience.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The human brain is a fascinating system in terms of its structure and function. The main questions addressed in this course are: How are brain structure and organization related to how people think, feel, and behave? Conversely, how are thoughts and ideas represented in the brain? Although these questions are examined from a variety of research approaches, the main one is the study of brain-damaged individuals. Prerequisite(s): Neuroscience/Psychology 200 or 363 or Psychology 230.  Not open to students who have received credit for Neuroscience 330 or Psychology 330. Normally offered every year. J. Prichard.<br/></span></div>

Independent Study.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Students, in consultation with a faculty advisor, individually design and plan a course of study or research not offered in the curriculum. Course work includes a reflective component, evaluation, and completion of an agreed-upon product. Sponsorship by a faculty member in the program/department, a course prospectus, and permission of the chair are required. Students may register for no more than one independent study per semester.  Normally offered every semester. Staff.<br/></span></div>
<div class="Course"><a name="363"/><a name="NS/PY363"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 363. Physiological Psychology.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The course is an introduction to the concepts and methods used in the study of physiological mechanisms underlying behavior. Topics include an introduction to neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; an examination of sensory and motor mechanisms; and the physiological bases of ingestion, sexual behavior, reinforcement, learning, memory, and abnormal behavior. Laboratory work includes examination of neuroanatomy and development of surgical and histological skills. Prerequisite(s): Neuroscience/Psychology 200 or Biology/Neuroscience 308.  Not open to students who have received credit for Neuroscience 363 or Psychology 363. Normally offered every year. J. Kelsey.<br/></span></div>
