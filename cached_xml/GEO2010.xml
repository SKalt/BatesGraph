Earth Surface Environments and Environmental Change.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The Earth's surface environments are in a constant state of change resulting from the interaction of its atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and lithosphere. Changes on the surface occur on various time scales from brief, severe storms to glaciations lasting thousands of years, to changes in continents and ocean basin environments occurring over millions of years due to tectonic processes. Studies of surficial processes and materials illustrate the dynamic nature of the Earth and provide a key to understanding past and future environmental change. The lectures are complemented with field and laboratory study. Field experiences include day trips to the Saco River, the Maine coast, or the White Mountains.

Plate Tectonics and Tectonic Hazards.</h4><span class="CourseDesc"> Volcanoes, earthquakes, and tsunamis are examples of tectonic hazards that directly affect human populations. Yet the processes responsible for such natural hazards are an integral part of the global tectonic cycle that over millions of years results in the formation of ocean basins, mountain ranges, and the global-scale motion of continents. Study of active and ancient tectonic activity is key to forecasting future volcanic eruptions and earthquakes as well as global environment change. The laboratory component emphasizes understanding global tectonic processes and reconstructing the tectonic history of southwestern Maine through field studies.

Quaternary Geology.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The Quaternary Period, representing the last 1.6 million years of geologic history, is characterized by extreme climatic fluctuations with effects ranging from globally synchronous glacier expansions to periods warmer than present. Records of the climatic fluctuations are contained in sediments on land and in the oceans and lakes and also in the stratigraphy of ice caps. This course examines various climate proxy records and the dating methods used to constrain them. Fieldwork focuses on the recovery of sediment cores from local lakes, while indoor labs emphasize physical, chemical, and paleontological analyses of the sediment cores.

However, during the height of the last ice age, about 18,000 years ago, major ice sheets extended to mid-latitudes from the polar regions and to lower elevations in mountainous regions of low latitudes. Lectures investigate processes of modern glaciers, evidence for former extent, and the cause of climatic variability between glacial and interglacial periods. The laboratory introduces students to glaciogenic sediments, stratigraphic analysis, glacial landforms, and field mapping.

Plate Tectonics, Climate Change, and Landscape.</h4><span class="CourseDesc"> Plate tectonics and climate often interact in profound ways. For example, high rainfall creates rapid erosion that reduces the height of compressional mountain ranges; ash plumes from arc volcanism may trigger global cooling and also restore water to the atmosphere and oceans. This seminar explores these and other relationships with a focus on active tectonic environments and today's climate as well as paleoclimate change and ancient tectonics. Students give in-class presentations on these topics from the current literature and investigate in the lab the fundamentals of tectonic processes.

<div class="Course"><a name="s36"/><a name="GEOs36"/><h4 class="crsname">GEO s36. Coastal Hazards.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Humans have always lived along the world's coastlines. Constantly changing coastal landscapes, combined with increases in coastal populations, present a unique and challenging set of pressures for people living at the boundary between land and sea. In this course, students explore coastal processes (e.g., erosion, sea level rise, storm events, and tsunamis) and coastal features (e.g., beaches, salt marshes, and barrier islands) in a variety of geological settings. The first half of the course is spent studying sites in Maine; the second half of the course is spent studying coastlines in Iceland and the Netherlands, two places where people have taken extreme measures to live by the sea and to mitigate coastal hazards. Prerequisite(s): Geology 103, 104, 107, 108, or 109. Enrollment limited to 14. Offered with varying frequency. B.

<div class="Course"><a name="s37"/><a name="ES/GEs37"/><h4 class="crsname">ES/GE s37. Introduction to Hydrogeology.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Hydrogeology is the study of the interactions between water and earth materials and processes. This course uses hydrogeology as a disciplinary framework for learning about groundwater processes, contamination, supply, use, and management. Students are engaged in class research projects along the Maine coast and within the Androscoggin River basin. Field and laboratory methods are learned in the context of these projects for determining groundwater flow and aquifer properties, collecting samples, and analyzing water quality. The final research project is both written and presented to the College community. Prerequisite(s): any 100-level geology course or Environmental Studies 203. Enrollment limited to 16.  <span class="gened">[S]</span>  <span class="gened">[L]</span>  <span class="gened">[Q]</span> B.

<div class="Course"><a name="s39"/><a name="GEOs39"/><h4 class="crsname">GEO s39. Geology of the Maine Coast by Sea Kayak.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Six hundred million years of geologic history are preserved in the spectacular rock exposures of the Maine coast. Students learn how to interpret this geologic history by completing four one-week bedrock mapping projects of coastal exposures on offshore islands. Islands in Casco Bay, Penobscot Bay, and Acadia National Park are used as both base camps and field sites for these projects. Students travel to and from these islands in sea kayaks. Students are trained in kayaking techniques, sea kayak rescue and safety, and low-impact camping by a certified kayak instructor who stays with the group for the entire Short Term. No previous kayaking experience is necessary. Participants must be able to swim. Prerequisite(s): any 100-level geology course. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 10.  <span class="gened">[S]</span>  <span class="gened">[L]</span>  <span class="gened">[Q]</span> J.
