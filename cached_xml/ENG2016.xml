Introduction to Classical and Medieval Studies.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course introduces students to major topics, methods, and modes of inquiry in classical and medieval studies. By examining the transmission and reception of selected textual and material cultures of antiquity in the Middle Ages, students develop an understanding of the critical approaches that define the field. Specific topics and texts vary, but include such themes as "Images of the City" (Troy, Rome, Jerusalem, London) and "Lovers and Warriors" (Achilles, Caesar, Christ, Edward III), and are drawn from a mixed sampling of ancient poetry in translation (Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Lucan) and medieval texts either in translation (Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio) or in manageable Middle English (Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate). Historical and archaeological evidence is studied in conjunction with literary works to emphasize current research methods in an interdisciplinary context, with ample opportunity for questioning the categories of periodicity and genre that give rise to the definitions of "classical" and "medieval" studies.  <span class="crsaddmod"/> (Medieval.)

Thorough reading of their work lets us question their surprising affinities and differences: What did each poet take to be the place and function of poetry? Does the regional/parochial flavor in Frost's work enhance or limit its impact? To what extent are we justified in deeming Stevens a philosophical poet? Does Williams' materialist aesthetic limit the range of his work, or deepen its impact? What vision of life in America does each seem to offer? Students may consider the work of tutelary ancestors, competitors, and critics, but the focus is on comprehensive reading, writing, and discussion of these poets' poems, early and late.

How do we reconcile the Puritans' use of nature as providential barometer of their predestination, Edwards&#8217; idea that the world will "shadow forth spiritual things" once we turn from our abject self, and Emerson&#8217;s concept of "nature as an appendix to the soul" where self-reliant individuals find unmediated divinity?

Mencken's quote marginalizes Maine as a quiet, separate, anti-intellectual state, yet again and again, over the past two centuries, Maine writers have debunked this idea. This course introduces students to the characteristics of Maine's literary heritage, examining the ways in which certain literatures have shaped our understanding of the state's history and culture. What is a "Mainer," and what is a Maine writer? Students engage in close readings of works by Jewett, Longfellow, Moore, Roberts, Millay, Robinson, Chute, Strout, and others.

Like other forms of science fiction, Cli-Fi is shaped by a set of contemporary anxieties about human beings and their relationship with the environment and technology. But where science fiction is speculative, the world Cli-Fi characters occupy often looks a lot like earth. Intense drought spawns violence, racial discrimination, and migration. Resource scarcity breeds new international treaties and ethnic cleansing. What does it mean that the speculative genre has moved into the present tense?

The course frames imagination and the Lockean language about mind that accompanies it in the writings of Addison, Burke, Johnson, and Young. It then queries whether romantic writing (Schlegel, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats) advances radically different ideas than these earlier efforts. Finally it jumps to our contemporary moment and ponders how terms of explanation may once again have changed. The course asks whether or not the neurobiological picture of imagination &#8212; the cross-neural nature of cerebral processes, cognitive historicism, and imaging techniques &#8212; is at a great distance from what the eighteenth century once thought.

Perceived as strange and terrifying, and deadly to those who tried to chart and conquer it, the region was a source of the sublime; its inhuman greatness both inspired and appalled. Drawing on various genres, students examine the "Arctic sublime," considering its artistic and ideological purposes for Romantics and Victorians.

Numerous films are adapted from novels, borrowing their stories, and the process of adaptation can be studied. But novels also adapt themselves to cinema's extraordinary powers of seeing and editing. Many films align themselves with poems more than novels ("lyric films"), while numerous poems take films for their subjects. Students read texts by authors such as Russell Banks, Adrienne Rich, and Don DeLillo, while watching films by directors such as Stan Brakhage, Jean-Luc Godard, and Claire Denis.

Psychological, political, philosophical, and prophetic preoccupations come to startling focus in poetries specifically responsive to the earth and locale. Students consider poets from several traditions, such as Virgil, Horace, Marvell, Bash&#244;, Wordsworth, Emerson, Whitman, Dickinson, Hardy, Frost, E. Thomas, W. C.

Students also create an "artist portfolio" in the medium of their choice (visual arts, music, performance, photography, writing, etc.). In her novel, <span class="cite">To the Lighthouse (1927)</span>, Virginia Woolf resisted the prevailing sentiment that "women can't paint, women can't write." How do twentieth- and twenty-first-century women writers represent female artists? How have transnational female painters and writers described their own creative journeys either visually or in writing? How are the female artists&#8217; personae, themes, and challenges different from male perspectives on art?

<div class="Course"><a name="395T"/><a name="AA/EN395T"/><h4 class="crsname">AA/EN 395T. African American Literary Issues and Criticism.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This seminar takes as its premise that black literature engages with and reflects parts of the world in which it is produced. In this course, students sort through the various conversations authors and critics have with each other. They read canonical authors and less well-known figures in an effort to tease out the nuance present in this body of work. Each text is paired with another in a form of dialogue. These exchanges are not set, so it is up to students to understand how the texts speak to each other. Literary criticism requires us to think through privilege, citizenship, capitalism, intraracial dynamics, gender and sexual dynamics, and political movements. The course theme may vary from year to year (e.g., disability, literature of the left, black queer studies). Enrollment limited to 15. Instructor permission is required. (Critical thinking.)

Medieval London.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Medieval London was dangerous and thrilling: amid its markets, brothels, and taverns, citizens and foreigners plied their trades while Parliament convened treason trials and authorized public executions, the king held court attended by the royal family and assorted minions, and the monks at Westminster Abbey took notes on daily life in the city.  This course looks at medieval London through the texts composed by its contemporary writers and residents, including Chaucer, Gower, Langland, Lydgate, and Hoccleve (in Middle English). Students also examine legal records, chronicles, and parliamentary proceedings (in translation). No previous experience with Middle English is necessary. Enrollment limited to 15.

Afrofuturism and the Black Speculative Imagination: A Study of Octavia Butler.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Of the 1969 moonwalk, George Clinton said that once man defied gravity, all bets were off. The music mogul later went on to defy gravity by "funk-ifying" the world. Yet Clinton's ideas are not without precedent in African American culture. In this course, students examine the aesthetic that came to be known as Afrofuturism as an outlet for African American literary and artistic expression. Students focus on the work of Octavia Butler and her volcanic influence, fame, and talent. Since her work dovetails with Clinton's anti-gravity stance and forms a locus for black speculative fiction in particular and speculative fiction in general, they study a selection of her novels, short fiction, and own words as well as secondary critical and theoretical material. Cross-listed in African American studies, American cultural studies, English, and women and gender studies. Prerequisite(s): one course in African American studies, American cultural studies, or English. Recommended background: course work in the natural sciences.
