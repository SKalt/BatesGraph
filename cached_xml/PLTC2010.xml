Black Women in the Americas.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course focuses on the political and feminist thought and activism of women of African descent in the Americas. In some years, the course features only one sociopolitical location: the United States or the Caribbean and Latin America; in other years, multiple regions form the locus of inquiry. Students use a historical lens to review Africana women's experiences in the context of struggles to democratize politics and society, and a comparative lens to better understand their location in social, cultural, legal, and economic structures. Examining testimonies of black women, students review their collective efforts to extend democracy and justice in some cases, or support the status quo in others. The course explores the tensions, affirmations, critiques, and contributions made by Africana women to gender, race, sexual, and national politics in their home countries and globally.

While some states have realized unprecedented degrees of political stability, others have fragmented into civil chaos. Novel democratic experiments have persisted while authoritarian impulses remain entrenched. And despite some of the highest levels of poverty in the world, Africa as a whole witnessed economic growth for the first time in decades. This course exposes students to the diverse mosaic of political life in Africa and examines factors that have shaped development and governance since the close of the colonial era. Attention is given to Africa's historical experiences, economic heritage, and the international context in which they are embedded. Students also explore the unfolding patterns of change witnessed at the opening of the twenty-first century and the way that Africans continue to shape their own political and economic situations.

Why do "contracts" so often seem to ignore the unequal power of the parties involved? Must terms like "community" erase the politics of human difference? How do categories such as "individual" and "state" restrict even the politics of privileged men as well as neglect considerations of gender, race, and class?

The Household and Political Theory.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Western political theories often acknowledge, either implicitly or explicitly, the importance of domestic considerations&#8212;such as child bearing, sexual relations, and issues of home economics&#8212;but rarely appreciate their political significance. And sometimes theorists who acknowledge that the personal is political miss the significance of the so-called racial classification or class position of the domestic situations they study. Drawing from Western and non-Western feminist, socialist, and other sources, this course stresses close reading of theories that highlight the politics of domestic life. Because many of these arguments involve criticism of Western political thought, students also examine how various Western classics (for example, Plato, Aristotle, Rousseau, or Hegel) situate domesticity.

What's missing from this picture? Identity politics often gives the impression that patterns of self and other are fixed in nature, culture, or both. The politics of difference marks a refusal to reduce life's ambiguities to orderly patterns. Various gay and lesbian constructions of sexuality provide suggestive terrain for exploring how theories of difference undermine fixed patterns of sexuality.

Do contemporary formulations of this diverse and venerable tradition show how to negotiate the contested terrain of twenty-first-century cultural politics?

Unheard Voices and the Politics of Immigration.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course examines U.S. immigration policy from 1965 to the present. The course includes a trip to the San Diego/Tijuana border to learn how key stakeholders on both sides perceive the problem of immigration and what types of solutions they desire. Following the trip, students explore proposals for immigration reform that recently have been floated in Congress and among policy thinkers and analyze the moral, philosophical, and political context in which they have developed. The final product is a website containing student observations, information collected at the border, individual opinion columns, and a unified reform proposal developed by the class.

Immigrant Rights Theory and Practice.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">How does law exclude both undocumented migrants and short-term migrant farm workers from membership in the community? How do these legally excluded migrants use the language of rights to empower themselves and to assert political claims? Students address these questions through three different levels of analysis: close reading of the scholarly literature on the politics of rights, examinations of film and media representations of the contemporary global politics of immigration, and participation in a service-learning project to assist organizations in southern and central Maine that advocate on behalf of immigrant rights. The service-learning component to the course culminates in a group project documenting the practice of immigrant rights in Maine. <span class="crsaddmod"/> Enrollment limited to 20.

Global Flows: Gender and Globalization.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Globalization processes underlie profound changes in politics from the state to private lives. This course focuses on sex and gender&#8212;as aspects of global economics, war, and politics&#8212;to uncover how power is structured, used, and challenged in the transnational age. Sex trafficking, militarized prostitution, women's factory work, and intimate labor are some of the topics through which students examine flows of people, ideas, capital, and political strategies. In doing so, students ask: How do gender relations and gender ideologies affect global restructuring? How does globalization (re)shape notions of manhood, womanhood, and the ways people live out those ideas in sex, politics, and war?
