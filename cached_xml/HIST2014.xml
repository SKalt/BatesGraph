Because Americans' efforts (both intentional and not) to define and shape the environment were rooted in their own struggles for power, environmental history offers an important perspective on the nation's social history. Specific topics include Europeans', Africans', and Indians' competing efforts to shape the colonial environment; the impact and changing understanding of disease; the relationship between industrial environments and political power; and the development of environmental movements.

Gender and Knowledge from the Renaissance to the Present.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The Renaissance sparked a centuries-long debate about the education of women, becoming a forum for the articulation of new theories of gender difference regarding the relative moral and intellectual capacities of men and women and their appropriate social roles. During this same time, scientific theories of sex difference emerged which challenged women's increasing participation in the homosocial world of European intellectual life. This course explores how premodern theories of gender shaped the ideals and practices of knowledge making from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century. Guest speakers connect this history to the present by addressing the challenges women continue to face today in various fields of knowledge, including mathematics, philosophy, and the natural sciences.

By contrast, the practice of social classification by race, is quite modern, dating to the eighteenth century. The idea that race biologically fixed a group's historical fate is newer still. How did notions of racial classification develop? When did these ideas gain traction? How were they institutionalized and with what consequences? In answering these questions, students chart the history of race in modern European thought, politics, and daily life. In so doing, they examine the consequences of changing notions of race in Europe and in the wider world.

Both tolerance and violence shaped the relationships between religious and ethnic groups in medieval Iberia. The growing influence of Spanish and Portuguese culture in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean in the early modern period resulted in the adaptation of Iberian ideas about religion, race, lineage, and blood purity to colonial contexts.

What are the psychological, cultural, and social roots of human cruelty and mass violence? What enables individuals collectively and individually to perpetrate crimes against other individuals in the name of national interest, racial hatred, or religion? In this course students analyze the nature of genocide by examining six examples of government or ideologically initiated murder: the Herero tribe of South-West Africa, the Armenians in Turkey, the Holocaust, the Cambodian "killing fields," the Rwandan genocide, and Bosnia.

How could a people who considered themselves a nation of "Denker und Dichter" (Thinkers and Poets) devolve into a nation of "Richter und Henker" (Judges and Hangmen)? We will look at this "twisted road to Auschwitz" from the perspective of its perpetrators, its victims, and its bystanders. When Hannah Arendt coined her famous term "the banality of evil" to describe Adolf Eichmann, a major architect and implementer of the "Final Solution" to the so-called Jewish problem in Germany and in much of Europe, she endured a constant stream of critical abuse. How could anyone describe evil as banal, as trite, especially when it had to do with the murder of millions. We will examine Nazi Germany&#8217;s dual war against the Jews and against human values and ask not only how it could happen but,
now that it has taken place, could it happen again? Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 40. (European.) Normally offered every other year. A. Peck.<br/><a href="#" class="gecIntProgramToggle" data-togglebox=".gecDetails">Concentrations</a><div class="catCourseInfoBox gecDetails">

Colonial North America.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course seeks to rectify the common misconception that American colonial history consists only of the thirteen British colonies of the Atlantic seaboard. Instead, students examine the colonial period from a continental perspective, examining a number of societies that Europeans, Americans, and Africans created in North America before 1800. Combining historical readings with primary sources such as documents, paintings, and architecture, students can appreciate the wide variety of American colonial experiences and some of the ways these societies were connected.

Revolutionary Europe and Its Legacies, 1789-1989.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course examines the European revolutions and their legacies&#8212;political, cultural, and ideological&#8212;over time. The French Revolution of 1789 brought unprecedented promises of political and social reform to Europe. Yet it also brought terror and authoritarian rule, a cycle that would seem to repeat itself, "the first time as tragedy, the second as farce," as Karl Marx said of the revolutions of 1848. In this course students consider these revolutions together with the Communist uprisings waged in Marx's name, and the "velvet" revolutions of 1989 that seem to have concluded this revolutionary cycle, at least for the moment.

British Modernity, 1688 to the Present.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">"American exceptionalism" is an imitation of the British original. Britain&#8217;s history from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to World War II has seemed to offer models for the development of an affluent, liberal, quintessentially modern polity. Yet ordinary Britons during this period seldom felt that they were living in a promised land. What is British modernity? This course explores the hallmarks of Britain's supposed exceptionalism, paying particular attention to the lives of ordinary subjects and how they thought about their relative freedoms and the need for further reform.

Ever since the Puritans decided to become a "City on a Hill," New Englanders insisted that they were different, even better than their neighbors.

African Slavery in the Americas.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Of the millions of immigrants who arrived in North and South America during the colonial period, the majority came not from Europe but from Africa. They came not for freedom but as human property, facing a lifetime of bondage for themselves and their offspring. Far from being the "peculiar institution" that whites in the U.S. South called it, slavery existed throughout the Americas before its abolition in the nineteenth century. By reading contemporary scholarship and examining such primary sources as music, letters, autobiographies, and material artifacts, students gain a sense of the ways Africans and African Americans survived and influenced an institution that sought to deny their humanity.

During this period, European colonies in Africa, India, and the Americas became laboratories for scientific and environmental experimentation, provoking confrontations between diverse cultures over patterns of land use and ideas about the natural world. Students read widely in recent historical scholarship in order to understand how the environment shaped colonial settlement and expansion; how imperial expansion then changed natural environments; and how the natural and human sciences bolstered and profited from imperial expansion.  <span class="crsaddmod"/> Enrollment limited to 15.

"Self-Evident Truths": A History of Human Rights and Humanitarianism.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">In today's world, activists and newscasters assume that we will care about the fate of peoples remote from ourselves. This was not always the case. Only in the eighteenth century did basic rights begin to seem "self-evident" and universal. Even then, the implementation of those rights was far from straightforward given the limits of an imperfect world. This course studies these developments, drawing on case studies from European and European imperial histories from the late eighteenth century to the present.

Muslims in Europe and America.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course examines the history of Muslims in Europe and America from the Middle Ages to the present. Premodern people debated whether Muslims could ever be &#8220;Western&#8221; in ways that seem remarkably familiar to us today. The course considers themes such as the Crusades and medieval conceptions of Muslims; the enslavement of Muslims; Muslim migration; and post-9/11 debates about terrorism, citizenship, and exclusion. In addition to more traditional classroom learning, students engage with the Muslim community of Bates, Lewiston, and New England through community- engaged learning, including field trips, local archival research, invited panels and speakers, and a final public history project.  <span class="crsaddmod">New course beginning Short Term 2015.</span> Open to first-year students.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Violence on the High Seas in the Early Modern World.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course investigates what scholars have called the &#8220;Golden Age of Piracy&#8221; in the Atlantic World. Pirates like Blackbeard, Anne Bonny, William Kidd, and their contemporaries have become fuel for countless stories on the page and screen. Nor have scholars been able to resist the appeal of these sea rovers, arguing that pirates subverted early modern conventions of race, religion, sexuality, economics, and order. Were pirates challenging nascent capitalism? Did they create a racially egalitarian&#8212;albeit criminal&#8212;world aboard their vessels? In this course, students examine the rise, nature, and demise of early modern piracy, focusing on the Caribbean, but including brief forays into other pirate havens around the globe.  <span class="crsaddmod">New course beginning Short Term 2015.</span> Open to first-year students.

Natural Disasters: History, Politics, Culture.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Are natural disasters ever really natural? From Vesuvius to climate change, social, cultural, and political realities have always shaped the way that "natural" disasters play out on the ground. These "unnatural" realities have also profoundly shaped the way that people imagine and prepare for future disasters. After considering the long history of cultural responses to disaster, students analyze contemporary representations of global climate change. The course culminates in clustered research projects on disasters in transnational and transhistorical contexts.  <span class="crsaddmod">New course beginning Short Term 2015</span> Open to first-year students.

Visions of the Past: Political Film and Historical Narrative.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">History need not be done on a page. Visual imagination&#8212;captured in photographs and documentary film&#8212;has often proved an indispensable pathway to historical, social, and political understanding. But have historians been well-served by Hollywood feature film portrayals of politically charged situations "based on a true story" that mix fact and consumer titillation to sell tickets? This course compares representative films of the "historical" genre to traditional written evidence about some controversial events in recent history. Can cinematic techniques truthfully illuminate dimensions of moral imperative and resonances of the human condition that printed words cannot? Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 15.

<div class="Course"><a name="s28"/><a name="HISTs28"/><h4 class="crsname">HIST s28. Wabanaki History in Maine.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The peoples of Maine known as the Wabanakis, including the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Micmac, and Maliseet nations, are pivotal players in Maine's history. Their early relations with Europeans shaped the colonization of the region and their more recent legal efforts to regain land and build casinos have affected everyone in the state. This course looks at the long history of Maine's Wabanakis, examining the ways that they have adapted to, fought with, and lived alongside European invaders and their descendants. Students examine some of the ways that European Americans' racism has erased Wabanakis' presence in the state and its history, the meanings of sovereignty in a state that still retains a great deal of influence over native peoples, and the role of environmental change in shaping Wabanakis' changing cultural practices. Students are strongly encouraged to link their final research project to contemporary Wabanaki efforts to recover their past. There is an extra fee for this course for travel to visit with Wabanaki community scholars and leaders. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 25. (United States.) J.
