Frederick Law Olmsted's contribution to the design of American urban parks, as well as their contested legacy in the civil rights movement, form a core study, along with some introduction to urbanist theories of space. Discussion of bioregional and cultural contexts focuses on issues around reclaimed and constructed landscapes. Study of the literature of open spaces, and of the interventions of contemporary artists and composers, develops an "expanded field" of aesthetics. Students are asked to pursue a creative-critical project, involving onsite investigation, in spaces at once social and natural. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 30.

<div class="Course"><a name="332"/><a name="ENVR332"/><h4 class="crsname">ENVR 332. Environmental Nonfiction: Theory and Practice.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The course examines the "nonfiction" impulse &#8212; in prose or verse &#8212; in relation to environmental concerns about place, science, history, advocacy, or social justice. Equal attention is paid to the practice of writing in a workshop environment and to critical and theoretical reflection. Students explore techniques particular to nonfiction including poetic forms and various approaches to science, documentary, and investigative writing, with considerations of narrative, metaphor, persona, and audience. Critical reflection focuses on constructions of "nonfiction," on theorizing connections between writing and environment, and on testing the genre's boundaries. The central concerns of "environmental literacy" run through both the practice and theory. Prerequisite(s): one of the following: English 291, 292, 395O, Environmental Studies 205, 213, s36, Interdisciplinary Studies 220.  Recommended background: Environmental Studies 203, 204, or 205.

<div class="Course"><a name="334"/><a name="ENVR334"/><h4 class="crsname">ENVR 334. The Question of the Animal.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">In an age of mass extinction, the meanings of human being and the uses of technology seem drawn into a circle bounded by the question of the animal. Through philosophical, artistic, literary, cultural, religious, and scientific studies, this course focuses on the trouble animals bring to human self-understanding. The investigation proceeds both as an inquiry from within the Western tradition, which locates humanity in an expulsion of the animal, and as an examination of traditions in which the differences between humans and animals are more varied and integrated. Themes include the wild and the tame, meat, religion, animal rights, sex and gender, race, languages, companion animals, and animal representations and performances. Discussions focus around cultural cases drawn from literature, the arts, and contemporary media. Enrollment limited to 18. Normally offered every other year. J. Skinner.<br/></span></div>

Social Movements, NGOs, and the Environment.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">As emerging transnational actors, social movements and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) challenge state-centered paradigms with regard to environmental and other issues. But why do environmental movements arise in the first place? Do NGOs necessarily "do environmental good"? What solutions to the environment-development quandary do these forms of activism offer? The course first locates the context for NGOs and social movements within neoliberal globalization and the resource conflicts that emerge from its processes. Students consider topics and case studies in developed and developing countries, using them as a lens through which to understand the complexities of social and environmental change.

Nature and Culture in European Art Film.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">European art film tends to be more realistic than Hollywood film, yet at the same time it is more conscious of its artifice. What does nature look like when framed in these art-conscious, self-reflexive terms? This course considers challenging masterworks of European cinema from the 1950s until today, with special attention to the place of nature in cinematic narrative and representation. Students watch two films each week and read several theoretical essays. Directors may include Ingmar Bergman, Andrei Tarkovsky, Jean-Luc Godard, Roberto Rossellini, and Claire Denis.

Shetland Islands: Archeological Field Course.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The main element of this unit is the excavation of a late medieval/early modern farmstead at Brow, Shetland (Scotland). Early settlement in Shetland was on the margin of successful medieval colonization of the North Atlantic. The Brow site is a revealing "laboratory" in which to explore the interaction of climate change and human settlement in a fragile coastal zone. A series of field trips in mainland Scotland place the Brow excavation in the wider context of settlement, environment,   archeology, and the history of Scotland and the North Atlantic. Recommended background: courses in medieval history or archeology. Cross-listed in classical and medieval studies, environmental studies, and history.
