<div class="Course"><a name="200"/><a name="NS/PY200"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 200. Introduction to Neuroscience.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">In this course, students 
learn how the structure and function of the central and peripheral nervous systems support mind and behavior. Topics introduced include neuroanatomy, developmental neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, and neuropsychiatry. The course is aimed at prospective majors and nonmajors interested in exploring a field in which biology and psychology merge, and to which many other disciplines (e.g., chemistry, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, computer science) have contributed. Prerequisite(s): PSYC 101 or any 100-level biology course. Not open to students who have received credit for PSYC 215. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 50. (Biological.) Normally offered every year. J. Castro, N. Koven.<br/><a href="#" class="gecIntProgramToggle" data-togglebox=".gecDetails">Concentrations</a><div class="catCourseInfoBox gecDetails">
