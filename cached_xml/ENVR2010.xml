The apocalypse, Christ's second coming, represents but one of many scenarios. Natural disaster, such as precipitated the extinction of the dinosaurs, is a more science-based scenario. A politically inspired scenario is the fear of nuclear annihilation. More recently, the specter of a posthuman world has increasingly come forward. All these scenarios employ a radical rhetoric of ultimate ending. What do they hope to achieve through its use? This course proposes a historical and analytical investigation of these four end-of-the-world scenarios.

Soils.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Depending on one's point of view, soils are geological units, ecosystems, the foundation of plant life, a place for microbes to live, building material, or just dirt. This course takes a scientific perspective and explores the genesis of soils, their distribution and characteristics, and their interaction with plants. Field studies emphasize description of soils, inferences about soil formation, and placement within a landscape context. Labs investigate the chemistry of soils and their role in forestry and agriculture. Prerequisite(s): Environmental Studies 203; or one chemistry set (Chemistry 107A-108A or Chemistry/Environmental Studies 107B-108B) and one 200-level biology or geology course.

Social Movements, NGOs, and the Environment.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">As emerging transnational actors, social movements and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) challenge state-centered paradigms with regard to environmental and other issues. But why do environmental movements arise in the first place? Do NGOs necessarily "do environmental good"? What solutions to the environment/development quandary do these forms of activism offer? The course first locates the context for NGOs and social movements within neoliberal globalization and the resource conflicts that emerge from its processes. Students consider topics and case studies in developed and developing countries, using them as a lens through which to understand the complexities of social and environmental change.
