This course not only provides a close analysis of Chinese visual and performing arts as social, cultural, and political institutions, but also looks into the political struggles and intellectual debates that have shaped artistic creation. The dramatic dialogue between politics and artistic creation in China since 1949 has been the most obscure yet crucial part of the bigger picture of constructing a "socialistic culture" within the parameters prescribed by the Chinese Communist Party. Students consider such art forms as painting, propaganda posters, sculpture, music, film, dance, and theater. Cross-listed in Asian Studies, Japanese, and Women and Gender Studies.

Over the last three decades, China has experienced rapid structural change as tens of millions of Chinese have moved out of the agriculture sector and into the industrial and service sectors. The concomitant migration of workers from the countryside to urban areas is the largest migration in human history. Students focus on the distributional implications of China's reform experience. They consider which institutional legacies are shaping emerging labor markets, how far China has moved toward a market-determined labor system, and which segments of China's enormous population have benefited and which have been harmed by the reforms.
