The arts related to the religious traditions of Candombl&#233;, Lucum&#237; (Santer&#237;a), Rastafarianism, Vodun, and Kongo-derived religions are explored through a multidisciplinary lens. Contemporary visual culture is discussed in addition to arts created for the purpose of worship or memory, such as sculptural figures, altars, garments, and yard shows. A short trip to New York City to visit sites of these arts is an integral part of the unit. In exploring these arts of the diaspora, the unit considers and challenges constructions of race, ethnicity, and Africanicity from insiders' and outsiders' perspectives.

Pinhole Photography.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The method and appearance of pinhole images extend the possibilities of photography and "drawing with light." The very immediate and low-tech process of pinhole photography, using just a light-tight container with a tiny opening as a camera, offers a prolonged and intense engagement with surroundings and subjects. Due to the lensless camera, minuscule aperture, and long exposure time, pinhole images provide a different treatment of time and space, often appearing timeless and ethereal. In this unit students create pinhole cameras and images to explore this form of image making. There is a laboratory fee of $40. Prerequisite(s): Art and Visual Culture 218. Not open to students who have received credit for Art s22. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 15. Offered with varying frequency. E. Morris.<br/></span></div>

Museum Studies.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Analyzing how the history of museums and architecture has influenced paradigms of display and taxonomy, and how display and taxonomy have influenced museums and architecture, this unit views the past in an attempt to identify characteristics of new museum ideologies of the twenty-first century.  Few institutional concepts have the fortitude and resilience to continually defend and renew themselves from external attack and self-referential lethargy.  The museum "conquers" by slowly assimilating cultural challenges.  In the past hundred years, the museum has met these challenges while increasing its relevance and historical importance despite architectural makeovers, financial scandal, censorship, cultural shifts, and the ever-changing demands of new media.  As the work shifts from analog to digital, museums are presenting exhibitions of painting, sculpture, photography, and video to ever-increasing audiences.  Field trips are planned.

Desiring Italy.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">For four centuries Italy and Italian art have drawn artists, writers, and scholars from America and transalpine Europe. This unit focuses on the literature, art, and art history that have emerged from this encounter, stressing the work of such writers as Stendhal, Hawthorne, James, Forster, Mann, and the Brownings, and artists including Mengs, West, Turner, and Hosmer. It investigates the manner in which the nature of that encounter shaped the practice of the history and criticism of art from Winkelmann and Ruskin to Berenson and van Marle, and even the political life and material survival of Italy itself, and concludes by considering the recent spate of films that seek to evoke this now nearly-lost expatriate world, including <span class="em">A Room With a View</span> and <span class="em">Tea with Mussolini</span>.

The Photograph as Document.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Documentary photographs generally describe human social situations that aim to be objective transcriptions of events into images. This unit examines changes in style and methodology from classical documentary approaches of the 1930s and 1940s to contemporary modes of documentary photography. Using either traditional darkroom or digital imaging techniques, students produce projects that address the photograph's function as a document. Concepts of documentary photographs as witness and testimony are analyzed as is the issue of how these notions are challenged and manipulated by many contemporary artists.
