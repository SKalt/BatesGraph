Can the evils we see around us be reconciled with the classical affirmation that the world is created by a just and all-powerful God? This seminar considers the problem of evil as it arises in the theological and philosophical traditions of the West. Readings include Genesis and Job, Holocaust literature and Jewish theological responses, and contemporary writings in philosophy of religion and theology.

The Rise of Philosophical Analysis.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course explores the history of twentieth-century philosophy by examining the methods and characteristic doctrines of two   successive philosophical movements. Students first focus on the early twentieth-century attempt, pioneered by Russell and the early Wittgenstein, to apply the newly developed techniques of formal logic to the analysis of the cognitive significance of our ordinary ways of talking. The course then considers the way in which a later generation of "ordinary language" philosophers, including Ryle, Austin, and the later Wittgenstein, reacted  against this attempt. Readings are taken from the works of Russell, G. E. Moore, Wittgenstein, Carnap, Quine, Ayer, Ryle, and Austin. Prerequisite(s): one course in philosophy. Recommended background: PHIL 195 or two courses in philosophy. Enrollment limited to 15.  <span class="gened">[W2]</span> M.

This course is an exploration and critical analysis of current research in embodied cognition and artificial life offered as an alternative to representational and computational theories of mind in philosophy and cognitive science. Topics  include the nature of intelligence, the computational theory of mind, embodied cognition, representation, classic AI, behavior-based robotics, neural networks, genetic algorithms, dynamic systems, and the role played by computer simulations and robotics in cognitive science.

<div class="Course"><a name="321G"/><a name="PHIL321G"/><h4 class="crsname">PHIL 321G. Philosophical Issues in Cognitive Science.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field in which theories and methods from psychology, computer science, neuroscience, linguistics, and philosophy are used to study cognitive phenomena, e.g., thinking, rationality, perception, language learning, and language comprehension. In its broadest form cognitive science is the study of how organisms acquire, represent, manipulate, and use information. In this context the goal of the cognitive science is to provide an account of the sorts of mental computations that underlie intelligent performance. Traditionally computational theories of mind have been central to this project. In this course students evaluate the computational model of mind and discuss its application to three areas of cognitive research: vision, artificial intelligence, and language learning and comprehension. Students also discuss several challenges to traditional cognitive science and evaluate the relationship between the computational model of mind and new research in cognitive neuroscience. Recommended background: PHIL 232, 234, or 235, or PSYC 101. Enrollment limited to 18. W.

Dispositions.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Paradigmatic dispositions are fragility, solubility, elasticity, and conductivity, but discussions of dispositions occur in a wider range of theories than these examples might suggest. Dispositions, also called "powers" or "tendencies" are considered in, for example, analyses of free will, color properties, mental states, natural laws, and causation. Some argue that dispositions are the only type of property there is, yet others question whether there really are such properties. In discussing these debates, students cover several core topics in metaphysics and epistemology, including possible worlds and counterfactuals, realism and anti-realism about properties, reduction, and explanation.

Unlimited freedom leads to inequalities and remedies for inequalities restrict liberty. This seminar focuses on competing accounts of the proper balance between liberty and equality.  In particular, students focus on John Rawls' theory of justice and competing theories of justice, including utilitarian liberalism, Nozick's libertarian theory, communitarian theories, feminist theories, and multicultural approaches.

Virtue Ethics.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Virtue ethics emerged as an important kind of moral theory during the last half of the twentieth century. There are many virtue theories, but they share a focus on the morality of character rather than the morality of individual actions. Many seek an answer to the question, "How shall I live?" rather than, "What should I do?" This course explores both the historical roots of virtue theory found in Aristotle and, according to some scholars, Kant. It also examines several contemporary theories of virtue as well as critics of this approach to moral theory. Prerequisite(s): FYS 248 or PHIL 256.

<div class="Course"><a name="325B"/><a name="PHIL325B"/><h4 class="crsname">PHIL 325B. Moral Rules and/or Particulars.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Until recently many moral philosophers have assumed that moral justification proceeds by showing that, for example, an action falls under some more general moral principle. However, the existence and epistemic value of moral generalities have increasingly come to be questioned by a group of contemporary moral philosophers, including Aristotelians, feminists, and some British moral realists. These particularists have advanced the striking metaphysical claim that there are no codifiable moral generalities, as well as the epistemological claim that moral justification need not be parasitic on a supposed metaphysical relationship between justified and justifying properties. This course investigates these claims while also investigating the role that rules may or should play in morality. Prerequisite(s): PHIL 170 or 256.
