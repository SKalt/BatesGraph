<div class="Course"><a name="s33"/><a name="BIOs33"/><h4 class="crsname">BIO s33. Phenotypic Plasticity.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The ability of organisms to express different morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits in different environments has emerged as a key principle in modern biology. This unit explores the proximate physiological basis of this phenotypic plasticity. Other topics include the genetic basis and evolution of phenotypic plasticity, as well as the roles of plasticity in health and disease. Examples are drawn from both animal and plant studies. The unit is organized around discussion of the primary scientific literature and research projects selected with reference to research interests of the instructor. Prerequisite(s): Biology 101. Recommended background: Biology 270. Enrollment limited to 8. Instructor permission is required.  <span class="gened">[S]</span>  <span class="gened">[L]</span>  <span class="gened">[Q]</span> Offered with varying frequency. R.
