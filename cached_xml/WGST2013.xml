Gender and Knowledge from the Renaissance to the Present.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The Renaissance sparked a centuries-long debate about the education of women, becoming a forum for the articulation of new theories of gender difference regarding the relative moral and intellectual capacities of men and women and their appropriate social roles. During this same time, scientific theories of sex difference emerged which challenged women&#8217;s increasing participation in the homosocial world of European intellectual life. This course explores how premodern theories of gender shaped the ideals and practices of knowledge-making from the 15th to the 19th century. A series of guest speakers will connect this history to the present by addressing the challenges women continue to face today in various fields of knowledge, including mathematics, philosophy, and the natural sciences. <span class="crsaddmod">New course beginning Fall 2014.</span> Enrollment limited to 40.

Tobacco: Gender Matters.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">In the opening episode of the popular television show <span class="cite">Mad Men</span>, entitled "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," cigarettes feature as the primary signifier of mid-twentieth-century social norms and cultural divides. As <span class="cite">Mad Men</span> suggests, tobacco matters to our ability to understand the formation of cultural values and divides. In this reading- and research-intensive seminar students use gender to examine the global history of tobacco production, consumption, and control. Through historical and comparative study they also cinsider the role of tobacco in shaping ideas about gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, and class. Topics covered include the political economy of tobacco, tobacco control movements, tobacco and human rights, and health equity. Prerequisite(s): WGST 100.

Performance, Narrative, and the Body.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course examines the politics of the body through the  inter/transdisciplinary frames of the narrative and performance, including the specific ways performance and narrative theories of the body and cultural practices operate in everyday life and social formations. Students examine how the "body" is performed and how narrative is constructed in a variety of different contexts such as race, gender, disease, sexuality, and culture. The course places narrative and performance at the center (rather than the margins) of inquiry, asking how far and how deeply performativity reaches into our lives and how performances construct our identities, differences, and our bodies: who we are and who we can become. Recommended background: course work in African American studies, American cultural studies, anthropology, politics, sociology, or women and gender studies.

Gender and the State.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Two key questions provide the focus for this course: How does gender define citizenship, politics, and the state? What roles do states play in shaping notions of masculinity and womanhood? Theoretical framings of gender and politics form the basis for reviewing women's varying  relationships to states. Students examine processes through which gender ideologies shape state power and policy as well as how state projects, such as economic development or war, influences gender relations. Using case studies of women's political activism, students investigate how women (re)define their political roles and seek access to state power, thus pursuing different relationships to the state.

Critical Theory/Critical Acts.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Critical theory is about the unraveling of streams of repressive discourses and hierarchies in our contemporary world, and it has been artists who have fostered ruptures and fissures in everyday life. This seminar ponders the concept of "cultural worker" and laments the domain of theory by exploring the intersections between critical theory, art, and cultural politics. Students engage in the ruptures, the fragments of knowledge, and the making sense of the residue of "social change" while not forgetting the problematization of the aesthetic. They consider U.S.-based interdisciplinary artists such as Thiong'o, Fusco, Ana Mediata, Tania Bruguera, David Hammon, Jay-Z, Pope.L, and Lady Gaga with critical theorists such as Fanon, Butler, Foucault, Phalen, Mu&#241;oz, Moten, Adorno, Barthes, Dorothea Olkowski, and Benjamin.
