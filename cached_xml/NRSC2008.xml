<div class="Course"><a name="200"/><a name="NS/PY200"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 200. Introduction to Neuroscience.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">In this course, students 
learn how the structure and function of the central and peripheral nervous systems support mind and behavior. Topics introduced include neuroanatomy, developmental neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, and neuropsychiatry. The course is aimed at prospective majors and nonmajors interested in exploring a field in which biology and psychology merge, and to which many other disciplines (e.g., chemistry, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, computer science) have contributed. Prerequisite(s): Psychology 101 or any 100-level biology course. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 50. Normally offered every year. N.

Neurobiology.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The course is an introduction to the molecular and cellular principles of neurobiology and the organization of neurons into networks. Also included are the topics of developmental and synaptic plasticity, and the role invertebrate systems have played in our understanding of these processes. Laboratories include electrical recordings from nerve cells, computer simulation and modeling, and the use of molecular techniques in neurobiology. Prerequisite(s): Biology 242.

<div class="Course"><a name="330"/><a name="NS/PY330"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 330. Cognitive Neuroscience.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course explores how the 
neurological organization of the brain influences the way people think, feel, and act. Particular emphasis is given to the brain systems that support motor control, object recognition, spatial processing, attention, language, memory, executive functions, and emotion. Students also investigate clinical syndromes and unusual cognitive phenomena. A wide range of research techniques is introduced, including positron emission topography, functional magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological assessment, startle blink response, event-related potentials, magnetoencephalography, and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Prerequisite(s): Neuroscience/Psychology 200 or 363 or Psychology 230. Normally offered every year. N.
