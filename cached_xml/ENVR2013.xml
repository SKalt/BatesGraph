This course examines the urban environment as a coupled social-ecological system at multiple scales, from individual street trees and community gardens to global biotic homogenization. Topics may include the city as a physical environment for organisms, patterns of urban biodiversity, ecological processes in cities, how cities do (and do not) provide essential ecosystem services to their residents, and applications of ecological science to urban planning and design. Lab activities may combine geospatial and observational approaches, and may include a full-day weekend field trip. Recommended background: BIO 270.

This course takes a scientific perspective and explores the genesis of soils, their distribution and characteristics, and their interaction with plants. Field studies emphasize description of soils, inferences about soil formation, and placement within a landscape context. Labs investigate the chemistry of soils and their role in forestry and agriculture. Prerequisite(s): ENVR 203; or two terms of  chemistry (CHEM 107A, CH/ES 107B, or FYS 398 and CHEM 108A or CH/ES 108B) and one 200-level biology or geology course.

But why do environmental movements arise in the first place? Do NGOs necessarily "do environmental good"? What solutions to the environment/development quandary do these forms of activism offer? The course first locates the context for NGOs and social movements within neoliberal globalization and the resource conflicts that emerge from its processes. Students consider topics and case studies in developed and developing countries, using them as a lens through which to understand the complexities of social and environmental change.

Literatures of Agriculture.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course explores the ways in which agrarian life has been imagined, written about, and lived in a wide array of cultural and historical settings. Classic pastoral suggests that the life of the countryside is a life of virtue and freedom from the entanglements of politics and the city. The actual experience of farm labor is often embedded in difficult political, economic, and environmental realities, even as farmers profess deep affection for their labor and the land. Students explore a broad range of genres, from agrarian essay to historical studies, memoirs, and novels, considering how different forms of writing articulate ideals, aspirations, and realities. Students visit local farms and interview local farmers. Prerequisite(s): ENVR 205. Enrollment limited to 15. J. Costlow.<br/></span></div>

Readings for this course, drawn primarily from twentieth-century authors, may include political/philosophical epic (Pasternak's <span class="cite">Doctor Zhivago</span>); the dystopian work of Zamiatin and McCarthy (<span class="cite">We</span>, <span class="cite">The Road</span>); feminist science fiction and agrarian visions of the good life (Atwood and Berry).

How do power relations shape differential access to and control over resources? What makes people more or less vulnerable to environmental changes? The course applies critical social theory to case studies from across the Americas to explore how political, economic, and cultural forces shape environmental inequalities, and how, in trying to address those inequalities, various groups challenge and broaden the assumptions and practices of modern environmentalism.

This course gives students the chance to practice this remarkable human mode of transportation and then to experiment with ways of writing about the experience. In addition to reading classic walking texts, students talk with local people who plan sidewalks and trails, and who think about how to get more people moving. The core of the course is walking itself: urban strolls; woodland tracking; meditation; observation. The ability and willingness to walk in all weather is essential. Enrollment limited to 18. J.

<div class="Course"><a name="s38"/><a name="ENVRs38"/><h4 class="crsname">ENVR s38. Field Methods in Environmental Science/Lab.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Evaluating environmental problems often requires the collection of air, water, or soil samples from field sites. Knowing how to gather information and samples and how to be sure that they help address the questions at hand is challenging. In this course, students consider approaches for matching sampling design to study objectives, dealing with spatial and temporal heterogeneity in field materials, utilizing previously published approaches, insuring utility of data, and replication of studies. Students design and carry out their own study utilizing approaches learned in class. A one-week stay off campus at a field site may be required. Prerequisite(s): one of the following: BIO 125, 190, BI/GE 112; CHEM 107A, CH/ES 107B, or FYS 398; ENVR 203; or GEO 103. Recommended background: two prerequisite courses.
