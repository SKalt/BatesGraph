African Perspectives on Justice, Human Rights, and Renewal.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This team-taught course introduces students to some of the experiences, cultural beliefs, values, and voices shaping contemporary Africa. Students focus on the impact of climatic, cultural, and geopolitical diversity; the politics of ethnicity, religion, age, race, and gender and their influence on daily life; and the forces behind contemporary education policy and practice in Africa. The course forges students' critical capacity to resist simplistic popular understandings of what is taking place on the continent and works to refocus their attention on distinctively "African perspectives." Students design a research project to augment their knowledge about a specific issue within a particular region. Students interested in education issues focus their research on education policy and practice; their research project includes a field placement in a local school or community organization and participation in a twice-monthly seminar-style reflection session. Students who focus on education issues and complete the field placement and project have the course recorded in their academic record as INDS 100A (African Perspectives on Justice, Human Rights, and Renewal in Education), and may use INDS 100A to fulfill the minor in education studies, but not the minor in teacher education. The course is primarily for first- and second-year students with little critical knowledge of Africa and serves as the introduction to the General Education concentration Considering Africa (C022). Cross-listed in anthropology, education, French and Francophone studies, and politics.  <span class="crsaddmod"/> Enrollment limited to 40. (Community-Engaged Learning.) (Governance and Conflict.)

Students consider questions such as: Why do we play the sports we do? Why are sporting performances socially significant, and how have groups and political regimes used this significance to suit their needs? What can teams, players, and brands tell us about how we (and others) see the world? Addressing topics from cricket in the Caribbean to boxing in Chicago, students reappraise conventional sporting narratives and use sports to analyze the social and historical conditions in which they occur.

Cinematic Portraits of Africa.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Most Americans have "seen" Africa only through non-African eyes, coming to "know" about African society through such characters as Tarzan and such genres as the "jungle melodrama" or the "nature show." In this course, films from the North Atlantic are juxtaposed with ethnographic and art films made by Africans in order to examine how to read these cinematic texts. Related written texts help to answer central questions not about "Africa" but rather about the politics of representation: What are the differences in how African societies are depicted? Why are particular issues and points of view privileged? Recommended background: two or more courses from the following fields: anthropology, African studies, cultural studies, or film.

This course examines, from the perspective of anthropology, the circumstances that gave rise to this widespread movement and the modes of its implementation. Students reflect on the assumptions on which developmentalism was based, the expectations it ignited, and the reasons for its failures.

Decoding Disney: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in the Animated Blockbuster.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course uses the full-length cartoons so formative for this generation of students as "cultural texts" subject to anthropological analysis. Students learn to discern America's contested beliefs and values by unearthing cultural politics embedded in Disney Corporation's mainstay, feature-length animated motion pictures. Such demystification entails delving beyond surface messages to reveal underlying tensions, recurring contradictions, even counter-hegemonic themes. With respect to the particular intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, and nation, what distinguishes millennial popular culture from animated productions of the early twentieth century? What continuities do we detect? What are the implications of Disney's increasingly global reach?  <span class="crsaddmod"/> Enrollment limited to 30. E.

Gender, Sexuality, and Violence: The College Campus and Beyond.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Gender-based violence is a complex and multidimensional problem embedded within a broader sociocultural, political, and economic context. In this course students engage with a range of theories and texts to consider the specific forms and dynamics of gender-based violence and its intersection with sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, race/ethnicity, and class. The course critically examines modes of intervention aimed at eliminating gender-based violence such as surveillance; laws and policies; prevention strategies; response services; and education and awareness programs. Students evaluate these interventions through research and workshops with service providers, law enforcement, and legal professionals. Though the course situates gender-based violence in the United States, primarily on the college campus, students explore related case studies within a global context. Cross-listed in anthropology, psychology, sociology, and women and gender studies. <span class="crsaddmod">New course beginning Short Term 2014.</span> Enrollment limited to 15.
