<div class="Course"><a name="200"/><a name="NS/PY200"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 200. Introduction to Neuroscience.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">In this course, students 
learn how the structure and function of the central and peripheral nervous systems support mind and behavior. Topics introduced include neuroanatomy, developmental neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuropharmacology, and neuropsychiatry. The course is aimed at prospective majors and nonmajors interested in exploring a field in which biology and psychology merge, and to which many other disciplines (e.g., chemistry, philosophy, anthropology, linguistics, computer science) have contributed. Prerequisite(s): Psychology 101 or any 100-level biology course. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 50. Normally offered every year. N. Koven.<br/></span></div>
<div class="Course"><a name="308"/><a name="BI/NS308"/><h4 class="crsname">BI/NS 308. Neurobiology.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The course is an introduction to the molecular and cellular principles of neurobiology and the organization of neurons into networks. Also included are the topics of developmental and synaptic plasticity, and the role invertebrate systems have played in our understanding of these processes. Laboratories include electrical recordings from nerve cells, computer simulation and modeling, and the use of molecular techniques in neurobiology. Prerequisite(s): Biology 242 or s42. Enrollment limited to 12 per section. Normally offered every year. N. Kleckner.<br/></span></div>
<div class="Course"><a name="330"/><a name="NS/PY330"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 330. Cognitive Neuroscience.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course explores how the 
neurological organization of the brain influences the way people think, feel, and act. Particular emphasis is given to the brain systems that support motor control, object recognition, spatial processing, attention, language, memory, executive functions, and emotion. Students also investigate impairments and unusual phenomena that include alien limb syndrome, agnosias, hemineglect, phantom limb, aphasias, Korsakoff's amnesia, environmental dependency syndrome, and Kluver-Bucy syndrome. Prerequisite(s): Neuroscience/Psychology 200 or 363 or Psychology 230. Normally offered every year. N. Koven.<br/></span></div>
<div class="Course"><a name="360"/><a name="NRSC360"/><h4 class="crsname">NRSC 360. Independent Study.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Students, in consultation with a faculty advisor, individually design and plan a course of study or research not offered in the curriculum. Course work includes a reflective component, evaluation, and completion of an agreed-upon product. Sponsorship by a faculty member in the program/department, a course prospectus, and permission of the chair are required. Students may register for no more than one independent study per semester.  Normally offered every semester. Staff.<br/></span></div>
<div class="Course"><a name="363"/><a name="NS/PY363"/><h4 class="crsname">NS/PY 363. Physiological Psychology.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The course is an introduction to the concepts and methods used in the study of physiological mechanisms underlying behavior. Topics include an introduction to neurophysiology and neuroanatomy; an examination of sensory and motor mechanisms; and the physiological bases of ingestion, sexual behavior, reinforcement, learning, memory, and abnormal behavior. Laboratory work includes examination of neuroanatomy and development of surgical and histological skills. Prerequisite(s): Neuroscience/Psychology 200 or Biology/Neuroscience 308.  Normally offered every year. J. Kelsey.<br/></span></div>
