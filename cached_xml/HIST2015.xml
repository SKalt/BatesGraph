By contrast, the practice of social classification by race, is quite modern, dating to the eighteenth century. The idea that race biologically fixed a group's historical fate is newer still. How did notions of racial classification develop? When did these ideas gain traction? How were they institutionalized and with what consequences? In answering these questions, students chart the history of race in modern European thought, politics, and daily life. In so doing, they examine the consequences of changing notions of race in Europe and in the wider world.

About 100 speeches survive from the fourth century <span class="smcaps">B.C.E.</span> in which Athenians contested everything from wills and property to the worthiness of political candidates for office and the proper conduct of domestic and international affairs. Study of these speeches illuminates not merely the procedural organization of law in the Athenian democracy, but also the nature of political, social, and cultural structures in Athens. Consequently, the course concentrates as much on the various methodological approaches scholars have applied to the orations as on learning the mechanics of Athenian legal procedure.

British Modernity, 1688 to the Present.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">"American exceptionalism" is an imitation of the British original. Britain&#8217;s history from the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to World War II has seemed to offer models for the development of an affluent, liberal, quintessentially modern polity.

By reading contemporary scholarship and examining such primary sources as music, letters, autobiographies, and material artifacts, students gain a sense of the ways Africans and African Americans survived and influenced an institution that sought to deny their humanity.

It enunciated the moral vocabulary of a generation.

"Self-Evident Truths": A History of Human Rights and Humanitarianism.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">In today's world, activists and newscasters assume that we will care about the fate of peoples remote from ourselves. This was not always the case. Only in the eighteenth century did basic rights begin to seem "self-evident" and universal. Even then, the implementation of those rights was far from straightforward given the limits of an imperfect world. This course studies these developments, drawing on case studies from European and European imperial histories from the late eighteenth century to the present. Students examine how rights have been defined and how those definitions have changed over time. Recommended background: courses in European history and/or the history of European empires.

Wabanaki History in Maine.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The peoples of Maine known as the Wabanakis, including the Penobscot, Passamaquoddy, Micmac, and Maliseet nations, are pivotal players in Maine's history. Their early relations with Europeans shaped the colonization of the region and their more recent legal efforts to regain land and build casinos have affected everyone in the state. This course looks at the long history of Maine's Wabanakis, examining the ways that they have adapted to, fought with, and lived alongside European invaders and their descendants. Students examine some of the ways that European Americans' racism has erased Wabanakis' presence in the state and its history, the meanings of sovereignty in a state that still retains a great deal of influence over native peoples, and the role of environmental change in shaping Wabanakis' changing cultural practices. Students are strongly encouraged to link their final research project to contemporary Wabanaki efforts to recover their past. There is an extra fee for this course for travel to visit with Wabanaki community scholars and leaders. Open to first-year students. Enrollment limited to 25. (Community-Engaged Learning.)

Montezuma's Mexico: Aztecs and their World.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The Aztec state encompassed millions of people, featured a capital whose size and towering pyramids left the first Spanish visitors in awe, and developed a culture that continues to influence contemporary Mexico, from food and dress to festivals like the Day of the Dead. Yet Aztecs are more commonly remembered for their cannibalism than their complex civilization. This course examines the Aztec world: what it was like to live under Aztec rule, how society was organized, what people believed about how the cosmos worked, and why Aztecs practiced ritual human sacrifice.  <span class="crsaddmod">New course beginning Short Term 2016.</span> Open to first-year students.
