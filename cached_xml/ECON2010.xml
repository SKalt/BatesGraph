The concomitant migration of workers from the countryside to urban areas is the largest migration in human history. Students focus on the distributional implications of China's reform experience. They consider which institutional legacies are shaping emerging labor markets, how far China has moved toward a market-determined labor system, and which segments of China's enormous population have benefited and which have been harmed by the reforms.

Game Theory.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Strategic interaction is a part of everyday life, and so are the situations that can be explained using game theory. Game theory considers decision problems in a competitive environment where conflict, risk, and uncertainty are often involved; it is a powerful tool for understanding individual actions and social institutions in economics, business, and politics. The course focuses on the underlying theory as well as applications to social, economic, and political problems. Topics include Nash equilibrium, subgame perfection, auctions, and incomplete information. In-class games are used to illustrate the concepts. Prior knowledge and understanding of basic calculus and probability theory are essential to success. Prerequisite(s): Economics 250, 255, and 260. Enrollment limited to 25.

These issues require special consideration due to asymmetric information in insurance markets and the physician-patient relationship; uncertainty in health shocks and expenditures; and interactions between health care providers, insurers, employers, and public health insurance programs. The class considers these issues primarily in a microeconomic framework and explores econometric techniques commonly used in the study of health and health care.

Should we reduce taxes on capital gains? Should we eliminate double taxation on dividends? Should we replace our income tax with a flat tax plus a negative-income tax?  Would a value-added tax be better than an income tax? Are deficits a tax on future generations? Prerequisite(s): Economics 255, 260, and 270. G.
