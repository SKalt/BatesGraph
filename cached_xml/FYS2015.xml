Women in Art.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Beginning in the 1970s in response to the feminist movement, the investigation of women's roles in the production of visual culture has expanded the traditional parameters of art history. Now a leading method of analysis, this approach provides exciting insights into fields ranging from Egyptian sculpture to contemporary photography. This seminar discusses women as subjects, makers, and patrons. Topics include Egyptian royal imagery, women as Renaissance subjects and painters, Venus in Renaissance marriage paintings, women as Impressionist painters and subject matter, artists and models in the twentieth century, and women in the New York art world since World War II.

The Changing Climate of Planet Earth.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">The climate of Earth is constantly changing over vast spatial and temporal scales, from short-term and local to long-term and global. The geological records for the mid-latitudes of North America, for instance, illustrate periods alternately dominated by tropical reefs, lush coal forests, glaciers, and expansive arid deserts. This seminar investigates the evidence, possible causes, and impacts of climate change through studies of climate records ranging from glacial stratigraphy, tree rings, written historical accounts, and recent instrumental data. A special focus is directed toward understanding the possible effects of a human-induced global warming and its potential environmental, societal, and political impacts.

Students read and analyze ancient theorists on friendship and love, such as Plato and Cicero, and also texts illustrating the ways in which Greek and Roman men and women formed and tested relationships within and across gender lines. The topics under discussion include: friendship as a political institution; notions of personal loyalty, obligation, and treachery; the perceived antithesis between friendship and erotic love; the policing of sexuality; friendship, love, and enmity in the definition of the self. All discussions use the contemporary Western world as a reference point for comparison and contrast. Enrollment limited to 15.  <span class="gened">[W1]</span> D.

Many human needs are subject to fate yet are necessary not only to a good life, but to a morally virtuous life as well. This course explores the relationship between luck and morality, beginning with the metaphysical problem of free will. Then, turning to Aristotle's virtue ethics, students examine the role friendship plays in the moral life and the way it protects us from bad luck. Finally, they look at Kant's attempt to make morality "safe" from luck alongside Euripides' <span class="em">Hecuba</span>, which dramatically highlights the issue of whether virtue can ever be immune from misfortune.

Is it the cradle of all that is civilized and cultured, or the blood-soaked ground of empires, genocidal despots, and revolutions? The twenty-first century is witnessing the most peaceful attempt ever at creating a unified economic, political, legal, and social entity that is European. But is a European cultural identity necessary for the success of a unified Europe, and can one be created? Or is an imagined European community as illusory as Tito's ill-fated attempt to create a multiethnic, multi-religious, multi-linguistic Yugoslav community? In the seminar, students examine, critique, and propose alternatives to many of the received ideas about what it means to be European. Enrollment limited to 15.  <span class="gened">[W1]</span> D.

Children are often the least "acculturated" members of any particular society. What can we learn about culture from a child's perspective? These questions are probed by exploring childhood in a number of French-speaking countries and communities. Students examine (in English) a selection of narratives and films from the French-speaking world that feature the points of view of children. The course not only considers the ways in which narrative and film present childhood experiences in specific cultures, but also explores perspectives on issues such as family structure, sexual and gender orientation, child abuse, and colonialism.

The Celtic World: Archaeology and Ethnohistory.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Today, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany are often considered "Celtic" lands. This label evokes a series of related languages, music, and other artistic traditions with shared histories, but the origins of Celtic cultures are more complex. Over two thousand years ago Celtic peoples were the first iron-using populations to inhabit a broad area from Spain to Romania. They were farmers, herders, mariners, and craftspeople who cooperated, competed, and founded many settlements, raised many fortresses, and developed diverse and lively arts. Roman armies and migrating Germanic tribes fought hard to subdue the Celts, and they succeeded in many places. This seminar discusses the archaeological, documentary, and ethnological evidence of Celtic societies from their early origins to their recent histories.  <span class="crsaddmod"/> Enrollment limited to 15.

Our everyday economic interactions are within the framework of capitalism. Undergraduate study in economics typically takes this social system as given while rarely shining critical light on it. Apologists tout capitalism's attendant political freedom and wealth accumulation; detractors complain about its resulting materialism and injustice in the distribution of wealth. Economists, social philosophers, and theologians have critically examined capitalism.

There is a traditional belief among philosophers that our minds are somehow distinct from our brains and bodies. However, recent research in "embodied cognition" challenges this idea, arguing that bodies and minds have evolved together as efficient means to perceive and understand the world in which we live. This growing field integrates research from philosophy, psychology, ethology, neuroscience, and robotics. Students use exercises designed for Lego Mindstorms robots along with readings from philosophy and cognitive science to evaluate the debate between traditional and embodied accounts of mind and intelligence.

Roots of Nonviolence.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">How does an ancient text urging a distraught warrior into battle spark a nonviolent resistance movement spanning continents and centuries? This text, the Bhagavad-Gita, inspired Thoreau at Walden Pond and Gandhi as a practical guide for daily living. Thoreau&#8217;s essay "Civil Disobedience" influenced Gandhi&#8217;s satyagraha movement and both men's lives and writings fueled Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent struggle for civil rights.

The Nature of Spirituality.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">What do people mean when they claim to be "spiritual but not religious"?  Why do rivers and sunsets, trees and mountaintops so often come to be associated with spiritual power and connection to a greater Reality? This course invites students to explore such questions and phenomena through shared reading of a variety of scriptures, naturalist writers, and mystics; through producing their own formal essays, reviews, and creative reflections; and through experiential learning in a more-than-human world.

Holocaust on Stage.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This seminar studies the award-winning Polish play <span class="cite">Our Class</span>, by Tadeusz S&#322;obodzianek, which is based on the 2001 book <span class="cite">Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland</span> by Jan T. Gross. This controversial book explores the July 1941 massacre of Polish Jews by their non-Jewish neighbors in the small town of Jedwabne during the Nazi occupation. The play raises a question of national collective memory in the aftermath of World War II. Students study the historical events on which the play is based, and examine the dramatic structure of the text in the aspects of staging.  <span class="crsaddmod"/> Enrollment limited to 15.  <span class="gened">[W1]</span> K.

Race, Justice, and American Policy in the Twenty-First Century.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Is America "post-racial"? Recent media focus on police shootings, wealth gaps, and ongoing debates about immigration suggest that race and inequality continue to shape life experiences of Americans in the twenty-first century. This seminar examines current policy issues, asking how public and private discourses and institutional practices&#8212;historical and modern&#8212;shape understandings of race and justice. Students consider how perceptions of race, ethnicity, and "colorblindness" are embedded in patterns of disparity and investigate alternatives that ordinary people&#8212;in small groups, work places, and social movements&#8212;and some political elites are posing for more judicious policy to foster equality and racial justice.

The sport attracts the wealthiest as club owners and is played by even the poorest with nothing more than a round ball and a flat space. It has been blamed for precipitating ugly violence and credited for ethnic reconciliation. This course explores the politics of soccer, with an emphasis on how multiple identities&#8212;nationality, ethnicity, religion, class, gender&#8212;are expressed through soccer in the United States and around the world.

Science is an important aspect of many modern television shows and movies, but it is not always clear whether the science is viable or not. This seminar focuses on the scientific theories and methods underlying science presented in fiction. Ultimately, students determine whether it is important for science to be viable for the fiction to be effective.

The Natural History of Maine&#8217;s Neighborhoods and Woods.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">This course introduces students to the natural history of Maine by exploring the native mammals, fish, plants, and insects, with consideration on how humans have shaped Maine&#8217;s natural environments. One overnight trip to the Bates-Morse Mountain Conservation Area and one daylong trip to the Maine Wildlife Park are required. Relying upon natural history literature, poetry, and field guides related to Maine as a foundation, students utilize techniques in field studies to observe and document native wildlife and plants. A critical comparison of popular and scientific literature allows an evaluation of current and future health of Maine's natural habitats. Enrollment limited to 15.  <span class="gened">[W1]</span> B.

What happens if we extend, hybridize, or even discard the wet and messy reality of our brains for synthetic alternatives? In this course, we use science fiction to probe the links between brain and behavior, to ponder new psychosocial potentials, and to challenge current notions of subjectivity and representation. Students explore concepts such as linguistic relativity, collective consciousness, noogenesis, cybernetic threat, the exocortex, psi powers, and digital immortality through literature and media. Students are introduced to discourses of transhumanism, Afrofuturism, feminist utopia, and cyberpunk and its derivatives, and engage in their own speculative writing, design, and construction.

Dostoevsky's Brothers Karamazov: Reading and Contexts.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Dostoevsky&#8217;s final work is a novel about abandoned children and the quest for love, community and justice. It is the novelist&#8217;s greatest articulation of the nature of evil and the possibility of embodied love. Students read the novel slowly, paying close attention to Dostoevsky&#8217;s brilliant structuring of this intense, polemical novel, and how he enters into dialogue with a range of sources, from Biblical texts and saints&#8217; lives to icons, Romantic poetry, and political philosophy. Writing assignments build from close analysis of particular passages to a longer essay about one of the key questions posed by this great existential novel.

Games, Mathematics, and Life .</h4><span class="CourseDesc">Many situations in life can be framed in terms of different games. In this course students examine life lessons &#8211; negotiating with family, a landlord, or a business partner; making decisions about careers or investments; choosing a major or a graduate school; making trade-offs between different objectives like social justice and making money &#8211; which games like Backgammon, Set, Blackjack, Settlers of Catan, Oh Hell, and Sim City teach us. By studying the mathematics that frame and simplify these games, we can play winning strategies that help us, like Indiana Jones, "choose wisely" in life. Students should be comfortable with high school algebra. <span class="crsaddmod"/> Enrollment limited to 15.  <span class="gened">[W1]</span> B. Shulman, J. Stadler.<br/></span></div>

Students explore the wide array of discourse surrounding presidential campaigns. Attention is paid to political speeches, ad campaigns, debates, news reporting (traditional and alternative), and the use of social media in campaigning.

Environmentalism, Social Justice, and Education.</h4><span class="CourseDesc">It is widely believed that the environmental movement and the social justice movement are closely connected. Many of the same forces that lead to environmental degradation are also the root causes of social injustice. This course encourages students to debate emphatically and write persuasively about these connections as they are revealed locally in the Lewiston-Auburn area (including field research in the local community); nationally in cities like Flint, Michigan, and the fracking fields of eastern Ohio; and globally by considering the eco-militants of the oil-rich Niger River Delta in Africa.
