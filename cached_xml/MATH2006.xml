Bolyai and Lobachevsky independently discovered a new non-Euclidean geometry&#8212;a subject too radical to be accepted by the mathematical community at the time. After the work of Beltrami and Klein, Poincar&#233; stepped in and put the subject&#8212;hyperbolic geometry&#8212;in the limelight; this once-obscure discipline has secured a prominent position in mathematics ever since. This seminar examines the role of hyperbolic geometry in modern mathematics. In particular, the focus is on the connections of hyperbolic geometry to other branches of mathematics and physics, such as complex analysis, group theory, and special relativity.
